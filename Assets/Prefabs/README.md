# Prefabs manifest
- **Owner:** Worldbuilding & UI teams
- **Labels in use:** `shipping` for production-ready prefabs, `prototype` for art blockouts or VFX experiments, `test-only` for temporary layout prefabs, `deprecated` when scheduled for deletion.
- **Retention:** Review `deprecated` prefabs after 30 days; unlabeled additions are considered policy violations and will be flagged.
- **Notes:** Keep paired textures/sprites aligned with their prefab labels where possible.
