# Scenes manifest
- **Owner:** Level design team
- **Labels in use:** `shipping` for production hubs, `test-only` for harness scenes, `prototype` for work-in-progress layouts, `deprecated` when a scene is slated for removal.
- **Retention:** `deprecated` scenes older than 30 days should be archived or deleted; the auditor surfaces them for review.
- **Notes:** Keep sample or tutorial scenes labeled `test-only` to avoid shipping them accidentally.
