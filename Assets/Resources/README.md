# Resources manifest
- **Owner:** Gameplay systems team
- **Labels in use:** `shipping` for runtime-ready prefabs and data, `prototype` for experimental projectiles or art swaps, `test-only` for debug content, `deprecated` when phasing out resources.
- **Retention:** `deprecated` resources older than 30 days should be cleaned up or archived; unlabeled resources are rejected by the auditor.
- **Notes:** Keep icons and prefabs in sync on lifecycle labels to simplify clean-up decisions.
